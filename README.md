### Next.js + Strapi CMS Starter and Boilerplate

When you're looking around on github, you see so many nice starters, templates and you wonder where you could go with them.
Well I saw the [next-js typescript starter](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter) made by <a href="https://theodorusclarence.com">Theodorus Clarence</a></p> 
_and I knew I had to plug the Strapi CMS in it just to see where this goes._

It's still very much a work in progress but I got it running in a CI/CD in a droplet, I will make it public when I can !
